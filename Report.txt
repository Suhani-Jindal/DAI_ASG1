DATASET: AUTOMOBILE 


1. Dataset Overview

•Total Records: 398Features: 8Numerical •Features: mpg, horsepower, weight, acceleration, displacement, •cylindersCategorical Features: origin, model_year


2. Structure and Summary Statistics

•MPG (Miles Per Gallon): Ranges from 9 to 46 (mean ≈ 23.5).
•Horsepower: Mean ≈ 104; varies widely, indicating different vehicle performance levels.
•Weight: Ranges from 1613 to 5140 pounds; heavier cars tend to have lower MPG.
•Acceleration: Most cars accelerate between 8 to 24 seconds (0-60 mph).


3. Data Cleaning

•Handling Missing Values:
 -Missing values found in horsepower column.
 -Imputed missing values using mean.
•Duplicates: 
 -Removed duplicates using df.drop_duplicates(inplace= True).
•Outliers: 
 -Used Interquartile Range (IQR) method to remove outliers in numerical columns.


4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

•Univariate Analysis:
 -Histograms:Slight right skew, with most vehicles having MPG between 15-30.
 -Boxplot of Horsepower and car weights:Significant outliers in horsepower and weight before cleaning.

•Bivariate Analysis:
 -Scatter Plot Insights:Strong inverse relationship: as weight increases, fuel efficiency decreases.
 -Categorical Feature Analysis(Parallel Boxplots for MPG across origins) : Japanese and European cars tend to have higher MPG compared to US-made cars.

•Multivariate Analysis:
 -Correlation Heatmap:
	*MPG and Weight (-0.83 correlation): heavier cars have lower fuel efficiency.
	*MPG and Horsepower (-0.78 correlation): higher horsepower leads to lower MPG.
 -Pairplot:Clear inverse relationships between MPG, horsepower, and weight.
  -KMeans Clustering:
	*Cluster 1: High horsepower, heavy, low MPG → likely sports/luxury cars.
	*Cluster 2: Medium horsepower, medium weight, average MPG → balanced cars.
	*Cluster 3: Low horsepower, light, high MPG → fuel-efficient cars.


5. Conclusion from analysis:

•MPG is highly influenced by weight and horsepower.
•Heavier, high-horsepower cars have significantly lower MPG.
•KMeans clustering successfully categorized cars based on performance.
•Japanese & European cars are generally more fuel-efficient.
